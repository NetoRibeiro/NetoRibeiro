### About Me
Over 15 years of experience working in IT.
Throughout my career, I've been worked as Technical Support, Customer Success, and Business Intelligence Analyst, dealing with stakeholders, project managers, software engineers, and end-users.
Working in using the agile methodology I've accumulated experience to handle different priorities to manage multiple projects simultaneously.
I feel comfortable interacting with employees from entry-level to sourcing leadership ( Director and VP level) and I have got the ability to explain complicated or technical information in a simple way to non-technical audiences and also I have the ability to communicate it in a timely and straightforward manner.
